Pine Valley Furniture Company

Pine Valley Furniture Company is a small manufacturer that specialized in wood furniture
and has around 500 customers with approximately 50 employees with sales increasing up to
25% every year. Each phase in the production takes up to 4 weeks to complete. First, the
lumber is purchases in the nearby stores and is sent to a rough mill to cut the wood. The mill
consists of various saws, planer, gluing machines. The next phase is finish mill where the cut
wood that is obtained from phase one, is sent to the finish mill for boring, routing and
sanding the rough-milled parts. Now, it is moved to Assembly Department to assemble the
parts into end items of the furniture. It now reaches the final phase where the items are
applied with coats of stain and lacquer. The items will now be inspected and packed for
shipment.

The company uses various key documents, displays and reports that include customer order
form, customer display, product display, customer invoice, bill of materials, routing, work
center report, progress report etc. where each one has its own level of importance.
Customer order form is used to record orders which can be taken by email or through
phone calls. The form consists of information regarding order number, customer number,
customer name and address, date, product number, description of the order, unit price etc.
Customer Display is an on-line display of customer information which includes the customer
number, name, address, year of purchase, amount of purchase, credit limit of the customer,
outstanding balance, and discount amount. New records will be created for new customers
using an on-line terminal. Once the order is completed, the total amount for the order and
the outstanding balance of the customer will be computed and displayed. When the
outstanding balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit, exception notice is printed and
transmitted to the clerk.
The customer invoice is generated when the order has been entered and approved. For
every customer, two invoices will be generated. A separate invoice is generated after each
shipment. One of the copies will be sent to the warehouse and will be used as a picking
document.
The bill of materials is a listing of parts or components that are required to build a product
or subassembly. This consists of data like product number, description, part number, part
description, quantity used, location and code. The current bill of materials structure is
‘single-level’ or flat bill as it simply lists the various parts and quantities required for a
finished item.

The company stores a sequential list of operations required to produce a product. There is
one routing for each product and this included the product number, description, operation
description and time.

Progress report monitors the progress of each production order specified on routing. A daily
progress report is printed to state the status of each production order which pertains to
only one product.

All reports and transactions needed for everyday operations of the company must be
considered while designing the database that enables the company to maximize their
reporting and operating potential.

PRODUCTION PROCESS
Production at Pine Valley Furniture Company is mostly to stock. Production starts with the
purchase of seasoned rough-cut lumber of various species and grades. Most of the lumber is
purchased
locally,
and
there
is
negligible
lead
for
most
items.
The lumber is first sent to the rough mill, where the basic parts used in the furniture are cut
and prepared. The rough mill consists of power saws, planers, gluing machines, and other
tools that are used to cut and form these parts. A typical production order requires about 1
week in the rough mill (this includes queue time, when the order is waiting for other orders
to
be
completed).
From the rough mill an order is sent to the finish mill, which is responsible for boring,
routing, and sanding the rough-milled parts. A typical order requires 1 week in this
department. The order is then moved to the Assembly Department, which assembles the
finished parts into end items of furniture. Finally, these items travel to the Finish
Department, which applies coats of stain and lacquer. The items are then inspected and
packed for shipment. A typical order requires 1 week each in assembly and finishing. Thus
the total time required to complete a typical production order is 4 weeks.
